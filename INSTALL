Installation
============

1) Copy bin/itv, bin/iradio and bin/ictl into /usr/local/bin or into an other
   bin directory.

2) Create your own settings for itv and iradio. You can inspirate with the files
   conf/iradio_example.xml and conf/itv_example.xml. You can place it into
   ~/.ivtv/ or /etc/ivtv/ directory. If you want to be sure that your
   configuration file is valide, you can use RelaxNG validator:

   $ xmllint --noout --relaxng rng/itv.rng ~/.ivtv/itv.xml
   $ xmllint --noout --relaxng rng/iradio.rng ~/.ivtv/iradio.xml

3) If you want LIRC support, you can add the content of the file conf/lircrc
   into your LIRC configuration.
